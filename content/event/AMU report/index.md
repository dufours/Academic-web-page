summary: We had so much fun using R Shiny to create this **interactive report on antimicrobial usage on dairy farms from Quebec, Canada**. Check it out. We also provide the complete script used to generate the interactive report.

abstract: The purpose of this prototype report is to present the distribution of antimicrobial usage rate on Quebec dairy farms and its evolution over time. Our recent studies have  demonstrated the excellent adequacy of data obtained from an electronic central data set containing, for most Quebec's dairy producers, veterinary   sales data [**Lardé et al., 2021a**](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/9/5/1106/htm) and feed prescriptions [**Lardé et al., 2021b**](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/9/9/1834/htm). For this prototype report, we used data from a small number of dairy herds that agreed to have their data used in this way. In the future, this prototype report will be applied to a larger number, or even all, of Quebec's dairy herds, or to other types of animal production and could be updated annually. The report was generated using [**R Shiny**](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). The scripts used are freely available on my [**Github**](https://github.com/dufours/AMU-sectorial-report) account. You can access either the [**English**](https://simon-dufour.shinyapps.io/Rapport_AMU_laitier_EN/)   or [**French**](https://simon-dufour.shinyapps.io/Rapport_AMU_laitier/) version of the report.
