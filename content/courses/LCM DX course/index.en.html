<p>This <a href="https://lcm-dx.netlify.app/" class="uri">textbook</a> on Bayesian latent class models was initially developed to support a workshop offered with my colleague Juan Carlos Arango Sabogal. Bayesian statistical methods have been widely applied in veterinary science and epidemiological research. In particular, Bayesian latent class variable models (<b>LCM</b>) have been shown to be useful for estimating disease prevalence or diagnostic test sensitivity and specificity in the absence of a gold standard test. In this document we introduce these methods and illustrate their application using R and JAGS with concrete veterinary examples. There is also a series of accompanying exercises (named Exercise 1 - Proportions to Exercise 6 - Sample size estimation and study design) wich can be downloaded from the <a href="https://github.com/dufours/Dx-LCM-Bookdown/tree/master" class="uri">course repository</a> on my Github account. </p>
