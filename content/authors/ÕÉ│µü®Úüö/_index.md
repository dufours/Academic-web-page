Simon Dufour is a professor of veterinary epidemiology at the Université de Montréal's Faculté de médecine vétérinaire. He currently leads the [Op+lait](https://www.oplait.org/) FRQ-NT research group, and he is Co-director of the Chair in dairy biosecurity. He is passionate about epidemiology of infectious diseases of dairy cattle, about usage of antimicrobial in production animals and antimicrobial resistance. He also has a strong expertise in diagnostic strategies, control of infectious diseases, and development of data visualization tools for monitoring and benchmarking health issues. He has been involved in the training of many graduate students (most survived). Above all, he is passionate about learning and teaching.
